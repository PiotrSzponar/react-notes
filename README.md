# ReactNote.

React app that allows you to save your favorite social media profiles, articles or make notes.

### I used, among others:

- React Router
- Context API
- CSS Modules with SCSS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Demo

Demo version is available [here](http://piotr-szponar.pl/react/react-note/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
